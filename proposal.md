# 'General Versus Diplomat' Proposal

## What is 'General Versus Diplomat'?

'General Versus Diplomat' is a game between 2 players, a 'general' and a 'diplomat'. A player wins by controlling all 6 continents. If the general controls all of the continents, the world will be at war. If the diplomat controls all of the continents, the world will be at peace.

The game board includes 6 continents: (top row) North America, Europe, Asia; and (bottom row)  South America, Africa, Australia. Below the continents are 3 boxes: "Status", "Turn", and "World"

The game begins with the general and diplomat alternating in choosing their continents. Who chooses first is random. Each player will control 3 continents at the start.

After the continents are assigned, the game play begins. The general 'attacks' a continent for his turn. The diplomat 'negotiates' with a continent for his turn. For each move, there is a 50% chance of success. Success means that the player now controls a new continent. Failure means that the player loses a continent. Skipping turns is not allowed. 

The "Turn" box declares whose turn it is. The "Status" box tells the players what just happened, i.e. whether the last move succeeded or failed and its consequence. The "World" box tells the players the overall phase of the game, whether they are picking continents, struggling to spread war or peace, or if the game is over.

I'm choosing to make this game because I have always enjoyed world-domination-themed games, such as Risk and Civilization. The theme itself adds to the enjoyment of the game, even if the game-play is relatively simple.
